## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of an academic assignment to demonstrate:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Game logic implementation
- Event handling
- GUI development with Java Swing

The game challenges the player’s reflexes and basic math skills.

## 🕹 How to Play

- The player controls a ball character.
- Obstacles move from right to left across the screen.
- Each obstacle contains a mathematical value.
- **Correct answers increase the score.**
- **Incorrect answers end the game.**
- The game speed increases as the score increases.

## 🎯 Game Features

- Real-time obstacle generation
- Collision detection
- Score system
- Level system with increasing difficulty
- Restart functionality
- Smooth animations using `Timer`

## 🎮 Controls

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SPACE` | Jump |
| `R` | Restart the game after Game Over |

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Java Swing**
- **AWT**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

---

## 🧠 Game Logic

- Gravity and jump mechanics are implemented using velocity calculations.
- Obstacles move dynamically based on the current game speed.
- Collision detection is handled with rectangle intersection logic.
- Score and level progression are managed dynamically during gameplay.
